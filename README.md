The Faculty of Computing and Informatics (FCI) organizes a Postgraduate Academic Research 
Seminar each year. This event acts as a mini conference for master’s and PhD students to showcase 
their research progress and receive constructive feedback from evaluators. To improve 
management and transparency, the faculty requires a standalone Java Swing–based Seminar 
Management System that can support the following:
